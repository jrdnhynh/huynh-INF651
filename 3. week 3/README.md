#Movie Watchlist Application

A simple web application that allows users to create and manage a personal movie watchlist. This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts, including functions, arrays, DOM manipulation, and event handling, within a single HTML file.

##How to Use the Application

**Add a Movie**: Type the title of a movie into the input field labeled "Enter movie title". You can then either click the Add Movie button or press the Enter key on your keyboard.

**View Your Watchlist**: As you add movies, they will instantly appear in the "My Watchlist" section below the input field.

**Remove a Movie**: Once you've watched a movie and want to remove it from your list, click the red "delete" icon to the right of the movie title. The movie will be removed, and the list will update immediately.
